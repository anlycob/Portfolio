-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Gaming Room were the creators of the Android game application, Draw It or Lose It, and requested that a web-based, 
  cross-platform version of the game be developed. The Gaming Room required that the software support only one instance of a    game in memory at a time as well unique identifiers for team and player names.
  
-What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I thoroughly evaluated and weighed all possible strategies for achieving the client's goals. I proposed
  solutions based on fact-based research while prioritizing the client's wishes.
  
-What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  I found the design document to be most useful as a guide in the development process. I used it as an outline to see and    organize every necessary component of the software.
  
-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I wish I was more thorough in my evaluation of the operating systems. I think I could've been more extensive in my         research.
  
-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  
-How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

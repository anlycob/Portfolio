# CS-230-Operating-Platforms
- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Gaming Room were the creators of the Android game application, Draw It or Lose It, and requested that a web-based, 
  cross-platform version of the game be developed. The Gaming Room required that the software support only one instance of a    game in memory at a time as well unique identifiers for team and player names.
  
- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I thoroughly evaluated and weighed all possible strategies for achieving the client's goals. I proposed
  solutions based on fact-based research while prioritizing the client's wishes.
  
- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  I found the design document to be most useful as a guide in the development process. I used it as an outline to see and    organize every necessary component of the software.
  
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I wish I was more thorough in my evaluation of the operating systems. I think I could've been more extensive in my         research, which would have helped my client feel more confident in my final recommendations.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  As a cross-platform software, I recognized the importance of consistency in performance and the user experience across     platforms. I also prioritized data security so that the user could confidently play the game. It is important to           consider the user's needs when designing software because the user wlil experience the design firsthand. The software      should perform at and cater to the uesr's standard because they are actively interacting with it.
  
- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  I attempted to organize my design so that it could easily be used as a guide for similar software in the future. The       client's requirement that the software be available on multiple platforms is a general requirement that can be applied to future projects. I tried to use this as the foundation for the decisions I made when completing the design document that way they could be useful in designing other cross-platform software applications

# CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle
- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

# CS-255 System Analysis & Design
- Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well?

  DriverPass is a company that provides a platform for student drivers to take practice tests and get driving practice to prepare for the DMV test. The owner wanted to build a web-based application that customers and staff could use to perform tasks such as scheduling driving lessons and managing user accounts respectively. I identified the system requirements and planned the design using behavioral and functional modeling techniques. 
  
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  DriverPass' employees have diverse roles so access control was an important aspect of the system's design. The owner of DriverPass requested having full access to all accounts while his secretary only be provided with the necessary access to perform taskes related to customer reception and enrollment. 
  
- How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  I start by collecting the requirements and outlining project limits. Next, I create a schedule to help keep track of progress. Then, I use various diagrams to serve as blueprints for the system's function and structure. I will continue to use UML diagrams when designing software.
  
# CS-305 Software Security
- Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

  Artemis Financial is a company that manages individualized finances, including savings, retirement funds, investments, and insurance. They needed software capable of         securely handling customers’ personal data, both while stored long-term and during transfers.

- What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
  
  I did an adequate job of using the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram to create a mitigation plan. Secure code safeguards sensitive data from malicious attacks.   Attacks on a company's system software can lead to costly consequences like data breaches and customer distrust.
  
- Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  
  Although I feel confident generating dependency reports, I need more practice analyzing them. Resolving vulnerabilities requires a thorough understanding of the role each    dependency library plays in the software, which I do not have yet.

- How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

  I used self-signed certificates to encrypt data and identify the server. In the future, I will continue to conduct manual reviews of the code to check for things like       quality code, effective error handling, and proper use of cryptographic protocols to mitigate security risks. 
  
- How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

  I frequently tested the code to ensure it was both functional and secure. I also did iterative dependency checks during development to maintain its security.

- What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?_

  I often referenced the textbook for this course, which provided example code that helped me complete several assignments. I also fully expect to use the National             Vulnerability Database (NVD) frequently in my career.
  
- Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

  I would show the Vulnerabilty Assessment Report. It shows my ability to assess the business needs of a company and translate them into system security requirements.

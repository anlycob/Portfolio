# CS-230-Operating-Platforms
- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Gaming Room were the creators of the Android game application, Draw It or Lose It, and requested that a web-based, 
  cross-platform version of the game be developed. The Gaming Room required that the software support only one instance of a    game in memory at a time as well unique identifiers for team and player names.
  
- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I thoroughly evaluated and weighed all possible strategies for achieving the client's goals. I proposed
  solutions based on fact-based research while prioritizing the client's wishes.
  
- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  I found the design document to be most useful as a guide in the development process. I used it as an outline to see and    organize every necessary component of the software.
  
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I wish I was more thorough in my evaluation of the operating systems. I think I could've been more extensive in my         research, which would have helped my client feel more confident in my final recommendations.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  As a cross-platform software, I recognized the importance of consistency in performance and the user experience across     platforms. I also prioritized data security so that the user could confidently play the game. It is important to           consider the user's needs when designing software because the user wlil experience the design firsthand. The software      should perform at and cater to the uesr's standard because they are actively interacting with it.
  
- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  I attempted to organize my design so that it could easily be used as a guide for similar software in the future. The       client's requirement that the software be available on multiple platforms is a general requirement that can be applied to future projects. I tried to use this as the foundation for the decisions I made when completing the design document that way they could be useful in designing other cross-platform software applications

# CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle
- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
